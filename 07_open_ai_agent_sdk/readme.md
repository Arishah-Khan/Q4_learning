# OpenAI Agents SDK

## Introduction
The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is a lightweight Python toolset designed to build smart AI agents that go beyond traditional chatbots. These agents can automate tasks, make decisions, use various tools, and collaborate with other agents to complete complex multi-step processes independently.

## What is an AI Agent?

An **AI Agent** is a system powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) such as GPT-4. It operates by following instructions (system prompts) to:

- Use different tools,
- Make decisions,
- Delegate tasks to other specialized agents (handoffs) when necessary.

## What is OpenAI Agents SDK?

The SDK enables developers to create autonomous AI agents that:

- Work independently to complete tasks,
- Use integrated tools,
- Collaborate through multi-agent handoffs,
- Ensure safety through customizable guardrails,
- Provide detailed tracing and observability for debugging.

At its core, the SDK is built on fundamental concepts called *primitives*, which power the agents safely and efficiently.

## Core Concepts (Primitives)

### 1. Agents
- Language models enhanced with instructions, tools, and safety rules.
- Interpret user inputs and decide whether to use a tool or delegate to another agent.

### 2. Handoffs
- Automatic task delegation to expert agents when needed.
- Enables collaborative problem-solving among multiple agents.

### 3. Guardrails
- Custom Python functions acting as safety checks.
- Validate agent inputs and outputs to prevent unsafe or harmful actions.

### 4. Tracing & Observability
- Full trace of agent activities including:
  - Actions taken,
  - Tools used,
  - Outputs generated,
  - Error locations.
- Facilitates debugging and system improvement.

## Built-in Agent Loop – The Smart Task Cycle

The SDK features an automatic loop where the agent:

1. Receives prompts and instructions,
2. Evaluates whether to use a tool,
3. Hands off the task if another agent is better suited,
4. Continues iterating until a final response is generated.

This cycle empowers agents to operate independently without constant human intervention.

## Benefits of OpenAI Agents SDK

- **Python-Friendly:** Simple decorators and functions for easy agent development.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Divide complex tasks into subtasks handled by specialized agents.
- **Real-Time Tracing & Debugging:** Monitor agent behavior and troubleshoot efficiently.
- **Flexible Integration:** Supports any chat-compatible LLM, such as OpenRouter or Anthropic.
- **Safety with Guardrails:** Implement custom safety checks to control behavior and prevent misuse.
